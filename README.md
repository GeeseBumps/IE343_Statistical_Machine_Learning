# IE343_Statistical_Machine_Learning

This repository contains tasks and midterm project in IE343 Statistical Machine Learning class in KAIST (2020). 

You can check the pdf files in each task which explains the task. And there are also reports that I wrote. 

In this project, we are not using machine learning libraries such as Tensorflow,sklearn, pytorch... 

Instead, by using only pandas and numpy we make some models such as linear regression, logistic regression, LDA(Linear Discriminant Analysis), decision tree and SVM(Support Vector Machine)
